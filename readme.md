## Running Backyard
In order to run backyard on your own computer, you'll need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/ "NodeJs Home page").
Once you have it, download or clone the project and run `npm install` in the directory.
You may need to install software components as described [here](https://www.nodegit.org/guides/install/from-source/ "Install Nodegit from source") if there is no prebuilt binary for your platform. When you're done, run `npm start` *(and automate it in your IDE)*
